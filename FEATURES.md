Project consolidation status

This branch now runs a single Flask app with:
- Backend: main.py, adaptive_questionnaire_engine.py, pdf_report_generator.py
- UI: templates/index.html (vanilla JS/CSS)
- Tests: tests/

Pending cleanup candidates (to be removed if not used):
- package.json, package-lock.json, server.js, src/ (React), api/, netlify.toml, vercel.json

After confirmation, we will remove these to minimize file count and keep a Python-only repo.
