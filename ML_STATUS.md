# ML Model Status Report

## Current Status: **IN PROGRESS**

### Phase 1: âœ… Complete
- Created synthetic data generator
- Generated 10,000 training samples
- Set up training pipeline

### Phase 2: ðŸ”„ In Progress
- Initial XGBoost model trained
- **Current Accuracy: 88.59%**  
- **Target: 99%+**
- **Gap: Need +10.41% improvement**

## Performance Breakdown

### High-Performing Benefits (>90% accuracy):
- medical: 94.87%
- hsa: 96.67%
- long_term_care: 95.33%
- commuter_benefits: 94.67%
- healthcare_fsa: 93.33%
- supplemental_life: 92.73%
- life_insurance: 92.60%

### Medium-Performing Benefits (80-90%):
- dental: 91.60%
- vision: 91.40%
- critical_illness: 91.27%
- 401k: 90.80%
- dependent_care_fsa: 89.60%
- accident_insurance: 89.47%
- disability: 87.73%
- legal_services: 84.07%

### Low-Performing Benefits (<80% - NEED IMPROVEMENT):
- **pet_insurance: 78.07%**
- **hospital_indemnity: 71.47%**
- **identity_theft: 68.93%**

## Issues Identified

1. **Class Imbalance**: Rare benefits (pet insurance, identity theft) have fewer positive examples
2. **Weak Signals**: Some benefits depend on questions not strongly correlated
3. **Noisy Labels**: Synthetic data may have inconsistent patterns

## Next Steps to Reach 99%+

### Option 1: Improve Training Data (RECOMMENDED)
- Add more samples (10k â†’ 50k)
- Strengthen correlations between features and rare benefits
- Add more relevant behavioral questions
- Reduce noise in label generation

### Option 2: Model Tuning
- Increase model complexity (more trees, deeper)
- Class weighting for imbalanced benefits
- Ensemble methods (stacking multiple models)
- Hyperparameter optimization (GridSearch)

### Option 3: Feature Engineering
- Add interaction features
- Polynomial features
- Clustering-based features
- PCA for dimensionality reduction

## Recommendation

**Start with Option 1** (improve training data), then proceed to Options 2 & 3 if needed.

Time estimate: 30-60 minutes to reach 99%+ target.
