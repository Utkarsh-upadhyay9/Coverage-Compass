## Test Categories

### 1. Entropy Calculations (3 tests)
Tests Shannon entropy calculations for uncertainty measurement:
- ✓ Maximum entropy (uniform distribution)
- ✓ Minimum entropy (certain distribution)
- ✓ Entropy decrease with increasing certainty

**What it validates:** Core mathematical foundation for question selection

### 2. Information Gain (3 tests)
Tests information gain calculations for question optimization:
- ✓ Information gain is always positive
- ✓ All questions have valid IG values
- ✓ Diminishing IG as more questions are answered

**What it validates:** Question selection prioritizes maximum information

### 3. Bayesian Updates (3 tests)
Tests probabilistic reasoning and score updates:
- ✓ Answers update benefit scores correctly
- ✓ Correlation effects are applied
- ✓ Scores remain within bounds [0, 100]

**What it validates:** Belief updates follow Bayesian inference

### 4. User Profiles (4 tests)
Tests different demographic/financial profiles:
- ✓ Young single professional (prioritize medical, 401k)
- ✓ Family with children (prioritize life insurance, disability)
- ✓ High earner (include supplemental benefits)
- ✓ Near retirement (prioritize medical, long-term care)

**What it validates:** Recommendations match user life stage

### 5. Adaptive Questioning (4 tests)
Tests the adaptive question selection algorithm:
- ✓ Highest IG question is selected
- ✓ Stopping criteria (entropy threshold)
- ✓ Stopping criteria (max questions)
- ✓ No question repetition

**What it validates:** Algorithm optimizes question order

### 6. Recommendation Generation (3 tests)
Tests final recommendation output:
- ✓ Proper prioritization (Critical/Recommended/Optional)
- ✓ Life insurance coverage calculation (8-10x income)
- ✓ Disability benefit calculation (60-70% replacement)

**What it validates:** Coverage amounts are accurate

### 7. Edge Cases (3 tests)
Tests robustness and error handling:
- ✓ Zero income handling
- ✓ Very high age (75+)
- ✓ All questions answered scenario

**What it validates:** Algorithm handles unusual inputs gracefully

### 8. Performance (3 tests)
Tests computational efficiency:
- ✓ Entropy calculation < 1ms
- ✓ Information gain < 50ms
- ✓ Full session < 2 seconds

**What it validates:** Meets latency requirements

### 9. Integration Tests (6 tests)
Tests complete user journeys:
- ✓ Typical family journey (12 questions)
- ✓ Young professional journey (10 questions)
- ✓ Near-retirement journey (10 questions)
- ✓ Deterministic results (same input → same output)
- ✓ Similar profiles → similar recommendations
- ✓ Accuracy validation for known scenarios

**What it validates:** End-to-end system works correctly

## Expected Results

## Adding New Tests

### Template for New Test
```python
def test_your_feature(self):
    """Test description"""
    engine = AdaptiveQuestionnaireEngine(
        UserDemographics(age=35, income=100000, marital_status="married", num_children=2),
        UserFinancials(annual_income=100000, monthly_expenses=6000, total_debt=30000, total_savings=50000)
    )
    
    # Test logic here
    result = engine.some_method()
    
    # Assertions
    self.assertEqual(result, expected_value)
    print(f"✓ Your test passed: {result}")
```

### Best Practices
1. **Descriptive names:** `test_entropy_decreases_with_certainty`
2. **Print diagnostics:** Show intermediate values for debugging
3. **Clear assertions:** One concept per test
4. **Document expected behavior:** Use docstrings
5. **Test edge cases:** Zero, negative, very large values

## Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions (Suggested)
```yaml
name: Run Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: 3.8
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install numpy
      - name: Run tests
        run: python tests/run_tests.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### Import Errors
If you get `ModuleNotFoundError`, ensure you're running from the repository root:
```bash
cd c:\Users\utkar\Desktop\Xapps\BullDawg-Hackers-Repo
python tests/run_tests.py
```

### Failed Tests
Check the detailed output above the summary. Each test prints diagnostic information showing:
- Input values
- Intermediate calculations
- Expected vs actual results

### Performance Issues
If tests run slowly:
- Check if NumPy is installed: `pip install numpy`
- Ensure no debugging breakpoints are active
- Run on a machine with adequate CPU

## Test Coverage Goals

- [x] **Mathematical Correctness:** Shannon entropy, information gain, Bayesian inference
- [x] **Algorithm Logic:** Question selection, stopping criteria, score updates
- [x] **User Scenarios:** All major demographic/financial profiles
- [x] **Edge Cases:** Unusual inputs, boundary conditions
- [x] **Performance:** All operations meet latency targets
- [x] **Integration:** End-to-end user journeys work correctly
- [x] **Accuracy:** Recommendations match expected outcomes

## Next Steps

1. Run the full test suite: `python tests/run_tests.py`
2. Review any failures or errors
3. Add tests for new features as they're developed
4. Set up CI/CD for automated testing
5. Generate code coverage reports (optional)
